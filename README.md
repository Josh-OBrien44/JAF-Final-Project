This graph shows the number of butterflies found per institution in the entire dataset. These results were created in "CabbageButterflyByInstitution."
Some of the mistakes we made/encountered includes renaming the column names to be able to read much easier and to avoid the warnings while first creating the dataset. 
The T Test performed had a null hypothesis that the average number of butterflies was 30, and the T Test showed a p-value of 0.03826, which confirmed us to reject the null hypothesis. The average value was 75.91667.
We had difficulties finding what variables and values we needed in order to determine our p-value to reject our null hypothesis.

This graph shows the average total butterfly wing area by country. These results were created in "CabbageButterflyByLocation."
Some of the mistakes and difficulties we ran into included:
The T Test performed had a null hypothesis that the average total butterfly wing area among all countries was 560 mm, and the T Test showed a p-value of 0.03794, which confirmed us to reject the null hypothesis. The average value among all total wing area was 627.4414 mm.

This graph shows the mean, median, minimum, and maximum values of the total wing area (mm) differentiated by male and female butterflies. These results were created in "CabbageButterflyBySex."
Some of the mistakes/difficulties we encountered in this script was creating a tidy dataframe with all of the summary statistics (mean, median, min, max). We also had some difficulty placing each summary statistic directly next to each other so that the graph showed an easier understoof representation of comparing male statistics to female statistics.
