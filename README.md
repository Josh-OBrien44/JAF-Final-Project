This graph shows the number of butterflies found per institution in the entire dataset. These results were created in "CabbageButterflyByInstitution."
Some of the mistakes we made/encountered includes renaming the column names to be able to read much easier and to avoid the warnings while first creating the dataset. 
The T Test performed had a null hypothesis that the average number of butterflies was 30, and the T Test showed a p-value of 0.03826, which confirmed us to reject the null hypothesis. The average value was 75.91667.
We had difficulties finding what variables and values we needed in order to determine our p-value to reject our null hypothesis.
